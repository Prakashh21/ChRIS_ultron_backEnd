# Once a ChRIS/CUBE ecosystem has been fully instantiated from a run of the
# 'make.sh' script, the system will by default only have a few test/dummy
# plugins available. This is to keep instantiation times comparatively fast,
# especially in the case of development where the whole ecosystem is created
# and destroyed multiple times.
#
# In order to add more plugins to an instantiated system, this postscript.sh
# can be used to add plugins and also provide an easy cheat sheet for adding
# more.
